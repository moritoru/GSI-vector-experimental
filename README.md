# Experimental style for GIS vector
 
This repository stores my experimental styles for GSI vector.
https://maps.gsi.go.jp/vector/#12/35.675133/139.734845/&ls=vstd&disp=1&d=l

There still remain lots of things to be done but I don't know how long would it take.. so I will make this repository public for anyone to access, copy and modify.
